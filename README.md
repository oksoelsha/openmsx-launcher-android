openMSX Launcher - Android

This is an Android version that I started in late 2014 but never finished. It was based on version 1.3 of the launcher (before the embedded Derby database).
The biggest reason behind not finishing it was that the Android version of openMSX did not accept command line arguments which are needed to determine which ROM, Disk, etc to start.

The third part dependencies at the time were:

* android-support-v4.jar
* aopalliance.jar
* guice-3.0-no_aop.jar
* javacsv.jar
* javax.inject.jar
* launcher.jar (this was some of the openMSX Launcher modules)
